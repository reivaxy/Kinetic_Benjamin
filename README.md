This is first Prototype of a customized Kinetic hand for Benjamin.

The customization involved removing the thumb and first two fingers, and flattening the left side of the thumb, then adapt the TPU cover. Then making all new edges round and smooth for comfort, and add some padding inside the hand.

This prototype is mostly for size and shape fitting. Benjamin wishes regarding colors and looks customization will come later.
